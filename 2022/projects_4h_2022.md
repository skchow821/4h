The Dog Project is aimed at supporting youth and their dogs in learning basic obedience skills, such as heeling, sitting, staying, disregarding distractions, and more. Each month youth spend the meeting reviewing skills and practicing new ones, which they can continue working on at home. By project's end, every member will be prepared to enter the Santa Clara County Fair Dog Show in August. There are a couple of spots for youth without their own dogs, but otherwise youth should bring their own pets or dogs they have permission to work with. Meetings on Sunday afternoons."

## GARDENS

In the Garden Project we give youth lots of chances to get their hands dirty! We meet once a month and work together on our donation plots. Last year we donated over 1,000 pounds of produce to local food pantries! We also have presentations, workshops and lessons on various topics such as composting, pollination, putting together our own seedling sale, plant diseases and pests, irrigation, fruit tree pruning, etc. We have a lot of kind, experienced teens in Garden who are great working with younger members. There is an option for families to garden their own 16'x20' plot at the ranch, with a monthly ranch fee of $15. Others come only for the monthly meetings which are free and can help inform/support gardening at home. Meetings on Sunday afternoons.
